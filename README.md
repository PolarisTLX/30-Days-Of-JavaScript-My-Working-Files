30 Days Of JavaScript - My Working Files

At the time of this posting I am a third way through the JavaScript30 challenges
and I am getting better at understanding Github. 

So I have organized my working files of the JavaScript30 challenges into one folder
and now know how to commit these files to my Github repositories as I complete them daily.

These are of course based on the #JavaScript30 online course. Anyone is free to use these as they wish.
If you see any mistakes or have a recommendation for an improvement feel free to send them over!
