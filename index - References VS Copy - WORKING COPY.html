    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    //this returns 100 + 100

    age = 200;
    //this returns 200 + 100



    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    //these two return the same array

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';
    //in this case team returns ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'];

    //but in this case the original players array also returns ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'];
    //so changing the array in team also changed the array in players

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    //THIS HAPPENS TO ARRAYS but NOT to numbers, strings and booleans!



    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();  //if you leave .slice blank it will call the entire array
    //THIS IS MAKING A COPY, not a REFERENCE!

    //I PREFER THIS OTHER WAY to DO THE SAME THING:
    const team2 = [].concat(players); //this creates a new blank array and concatenate (push) the first array into it

    // or another way: use the new ES6 Spread method. This is also good
    const team2 = [...players];

    //ANOTHER way (4th method), but not a fan of this 4th method:
    const team2 = Array.from(players);

    team2[0] = 'Lux';
    //in this case players would be untouched but team2 would be changed



    // The same thing goes for objects/dictionaries, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {    //NOTE CURLY BRACKETS!!
      name: "Paul Rail",
      age: 30
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    //this is a reference and will replace the original as well

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 45, number: 99});
    //this is(empty Object, what you want to put into it, what you want to change)



    //in future versions of ES6/ES7  We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const captain = {...person};


    const Paul = {
      name: 'Paul',
      age: 30,
      social: {
        twitter: "@PolarisTLX",
        faceook: "Paul Alexandre"
      }
    }

    console.log(Paul);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, Paul, {name: 'James', age: 32})
    //in this case it is a copy, so the original is not modified

    //BUT anything that in twitter or facebook that is chaanged will affect BOTH!!!
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    //lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //another way, but also not recommended is:
    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(Paul));
    //this turns it into a string that can pass the whole thing. But then need JSON.parse to turn it back into an Object
